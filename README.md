Hello! Please know that the PDF version of this file is outdated. Somehow, my code broke and Knit will no longer work. 
The PS1_REAL_FINAL.Rmd is the code that should work 100% fine. It just won't knit for some reason. The in this repo
will work, but it is a lower quality version I did earlier. The error I got when trying to knit is:
Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) : 
  namespace 'xfun' 0.47 is being loaded, but >= 0.48 is required
Calls: loadNamespace ... namespaceImportFrom -> asNamespace -> loadNamespace
Execution halted
